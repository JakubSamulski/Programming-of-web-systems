      <b>Wrocław</b> is the historical capital of Silesia and Lower Silesia.
      Today, it is the capital of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship. The history of
      the city dates back over a thousand years;[5] at various times, it has
      been part of the Kingdom of Poland, the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Kingdom of
      Hungary, the Habsburg monarchy of Austria, the Kingdom of Prussia and
      Germany. Wrocław became part of Poland again in 1945 as part of the
      Recovered Territories, the result of extensive border changes and
